# Talk to CDEvents!

Welcome!

The [CDEvents project](https://cdevents.dev) needs your help to better understand how we best can serve the needs of the community in our work to build the CDEvents [specification](https://github.com/cdevents/spec), build proof-of-concepts and build integrations and extensions to existing projects.

## Take our survey

We invite everyone to answer our [survey](https://forms.gle/jBmzTtZFYMbN2wb57) to your input on topics like:

1. What does your current CI/CD set-up look like?
2. What are your issues and pain-points in your CI/CD set-up?
3. What do you think the CDEvents project should focus on going forward?

## Join the conversation

The [`#cdevents` Slack channel](https://cdeliveryfdn.slack.com/archives/C030SKZ0F4K) in the CD Foundation Slack workspace is the primary communication channel for the CDEvents project. Here you can reach the maintainers, contributors and interested parties of the project.

In the [`#sig-events` Slack Channel](https://cdeliveryfdn.slack.com/archives/C0151BTKEJX) in the same workspace, you can talk to (and maybe even join?) the _Events in CI/CD Special Interest Group_ ([SIG Events](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-events)) which works to support and promote the use of events to further interoperability and observability in CI/CD systems.

Come say hello!

## Contribute to the CDEvents project

The CDEvents project welcomes many different kinds of contributions, such as:

1. Help create the CDEvents specification.
2. Help develop a CDEvents SDK in your programming language of choices.
3. Help develop proof-of-concepts using CDEvents (which in turn will help create the spec.).
4. Help develop integrations in other projects to enable them to send and/or receive CDEvents.
5. Help build the understanding of what is out there, and what people want to achieve, in their use of CI/CD.
