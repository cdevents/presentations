# Metrics through CDEvents

<!--TODO
-->

<!-- Notes
- Four slides, one per metric.
- For each metric show a demo and/or example CDEvents relevant for the metric and/or diagram.
- Spend some time on the data in events, discuss how it can be used to correlate events.
Andrea & Erik? We could split, some metrics each

# Key takeaways

<!-- Notes

Something along the lines of:

- Metrics are hard regardless
- A common language can help
- Call to action
-->
